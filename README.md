# wasm-go-WebGL-ts
Overview of the Program WASM (Go) performs CPU-heavy calculations: Computes the Mandelbrot set, a mathematical fractal that requires heavy computations. WebGL (TypeScript) renders the Mandelbrot set onto a canvas using the GPU. The WebAssembly function is called from TypeScript, and the result is passed to WebGL for rendering.
